## Rules
1. If and only if a player (not dealer) encounter two cards with the same rank, they have the option to split. So at most they have two hands of cards.
2. No budget limit for a dealer. 
3. When a player loses, his/her bet will be forfeited.
4. When a player wins, he/she can get the bet on each hand of cards in the current round doubled back as a bonus. For example, player X claims a win in round when he bet $200 on each of his hands, then he could get $800 in total back.
5. A game can be played by 5 five human users at maximum. They can quit the game at their will whenever a round is over.
